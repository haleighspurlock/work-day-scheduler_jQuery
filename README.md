## Description
---
Enjoy this fundamentals of JavaScript quiz! Included in this repository is code designed to create a timed quiz, which also keeps track of high scores. The requirements for this project were to create dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

Working through this refactor is a perfect way to understand how to utilize functions and for loops, as well as their purpose in code. It is easy to try and explain a set of statements that perform a task should make sense, but until you write and execute something yourself, it doesn’t always truly click.
