## Description
---
This code was refactored using starter calendar code. The idea was to improve the app so it would run the HTML and CSS with dynamic updates from jQuery. I generated my calendar utilizing JavaScript and then attatched the classes. Functions were created using moment.js to update utilizing military time.
